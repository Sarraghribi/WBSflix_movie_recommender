 Developed a movie recommender system utilizing collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. 
 This project is a movie recommender system that utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. The recommender system incorporates multiple approaches to enhance the accuracy and diversity of recommendations, including user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, as well as content-based classification.

Features
User-based Collaborative Filtering: The system recommends movies to users based on their similarities to other users with similar movie preferences. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the system identifies patterns and suggests movies that users with similar tastes have enjoyed.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering: In addition to user-based recommendations, the system also offers recommendations based on a particular movie. By analyzing the ratings and preferences of other users who have watched the same movie, the system identifies similar movies that the user might enjoy.

Classification by Genres and Decades: The recommender system includes a classification feature that allows users to explore movies based on genres and decades. Users can select their preferred genres or decades to discover movies that align with their interests and nostalgic preferences.

Movie Recommendation Chatbot: The system incorporates a chatbot feature that interacts with users to understand their movie preferences and provide real-time recommendations.
